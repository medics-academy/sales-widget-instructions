## Purpose:

1. Reference your cards in a Blog and or page article
2. On the front page of your site, to help you maximise sales or sign ups
   
## Features:
Next features will arrive soon!
   - [x] _Include a discount code_
   

## How to do it?

1) Place the following _<script>_ near the end of your pages, right before the closing </body> tag, to enable them. 

```javascript
    <script>
        (function (w, d, s, o, f, js, fjs) {
            console.log(w);
            w['MedicsAcademySalesWidget'] = o;
            w[o] = w[o] || function () {
                (w[o].q = w[o].q || []).push(arguments)
            };
            js = d.createElement(s);
            fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];
            js.id = o;
            js.src = f;
            js.async = true;
            fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);
        }(window, document, 'script', 'ma', 'http://127.0.0.1:8080/ma_widget.js'));
        ma('init');
    </script>
```
